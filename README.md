### Nano Node Web Front

A basic frontend to see blocks, peers, current NANO value, and server time per NANO donation. This communicates to a NANO node via RPC, so make sure it is enabled. Rename config.js.example to config.js, then change the js variables to your needs for node address, server cost, and donation account.
